# WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF STAR WARS!  
# Ready to choose your favorite character?

## Overview
`I developed the design` for this project `by creating`   
each element in `Figma`. Throughout the project, I `utilized`    
`technologies` such as `React`, `Redux`, `react-router-dom`, `TypeScript`,    
and others, which will be `further detailed below`. This application     
is ideal `for fans of Star Wars`, enabling users     
`to choose` their `favorite characters`.  

#### How can you install Star Wars Project?

* `$ nvm use 16 or higher`

#### Let's do it!

## Build with
* `React`
* `Redux`
* `TypeScript`
* `axios` (for `convenient data retrieval` from a `remote server`)
* `react-rouder-dom`/`urlSearchParams` (for `convenient website`  
`navigation` and `improved filtering`)
* `react-select` (for `detailed styling` of a `dropdown list`  
to match the `website's design`)
* `react-spinners` (for `displaying` an `eye-catching loader`  
while `fetching data from the server`)
* `SCSS (modules)`
